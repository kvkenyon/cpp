Practice C++ code

This repo consists of files that demonstrate different C++ concepts. Much of the code expresses simple object-oriented
programming techniques such as RTTI, inheritance, abstract classes, and virtual methods.

There are also files that demonstrate (for my own learning purposes) concepts from Scott Meyers Effective Modern C++.
In essence, this repo contains learning material that I have constructed during the learning process.

I plan to add different design pattern implementations in the future.
